The flag of Sri Lanka (Sinhala: ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ ජාතික කොඩිය Sri Lankavay Jathika Kodiya) (Tamil: இலங்கையின் தேசியக்கொடி Ilankaiyin teciyakkoṭi), also called the Lion flag or Sinha flag, consists of a Gold lion holding a kastane sword in its right fore paw in a maroon (dark red) background with four Gold bo leaves in each corner of the background. Around the background is a Gold border and to its left are two vertical stripes of equal size in green and saffron, with the saffron stripe closest to the lion. The lion represents bravery of Sinhalese. The four Bo leaves represent four main concepts of Buddhism Mettā, Karuna, Mudita and Upekkha. The stripes represent the two main minority groups. The saffron stripe represents Tamils and the green stripe represents Muslims, and the maroon background represents the majority Sinhalese. The Gold border around the flag represents the unity of Sri Lankans.
